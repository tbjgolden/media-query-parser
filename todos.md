- [x] handle utf16 to utf8 conversion with TextDecoder
- [x] support `start`, `end` in lexer
- [ ] come up with a new parsing error shape and method
  - for the shape, a standard object will do
  - for the method, presumably we can "expect" tokens to be of certain types or values
    - each expect would generate an object containing a sensible error message
- [ ] make it clear in Readme how to use with csstree or postcss
- [ ] match csstree ast
- [ ] create generator
- [ ] more useful exported api
  - parse{MediaQuery,MediaQueryList,...}
  - validate
  - generate
